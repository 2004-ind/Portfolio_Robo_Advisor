Artificial intelligence is disrupting finance to improve cutomer experiance.One of the hottest trends to emerge in this area in recent years is the use of robo-advisors. These are software programs that use the data supplied by clients to create and automatically manage their investment portfolios.

In this project , I will create a robo advisor for both existing and potentially new customers to get investment portfolio recommendation for retirement by combining AWS with python.To accomplish this , I will perform the following tasks:

* Configure the initial robo advisor by defining an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

* Build and test the robo advisor to make sure that the bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

* Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function by creating an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.
